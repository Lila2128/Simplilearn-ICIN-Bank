  </ul>
  
<h3>Project development guidelines:</h3>
<ul type='disc'>
<li>The project will be delivered within four sprints with every sprint delivering a minimal viable product.</li>
<li>It is mandatory to perform proper sprint planning with user stories to develop all the components of the project.</li>
<li>The learner can use any technology from the above-mentioned technologies for different layers of the project.</li>
<li>The web application should be responsive and should fetch or send data dynamically without hardcoded values.</li>
<li>The learner must maintain the version of the application over GitHub and every new change should be sent to the repository.</li>
<li>The learner must implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.</li>
<li>The learner should also deploy and host the application on an AWS EC2 instance.</li>
<li>The learner should also implement automation testing before the application enters the CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li>The learner should use Git branching to separately perform the basic automation testing of application.</li>
<li>The learner should make a rich front-end of the application, which is user- friendly and easy for the user to navigate through the application.</li>
